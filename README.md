# ü§ñ PlayBot

PlayBot is an unofficial, experimental accessory for Panic Inc.'s Playdate handheld console, which transforms your console into a lovely little desktop robot. 
With its integrated charging capabilities, it can serve as a charging dock for your Playdate.

Here is a little video of Playbot (click to watch)

## üîß Hardware

The project is based on a Teensy 4.1 microcontroller that acts as a USB hub for the Playdate and communicates over serial. 

The Playdate acts as the robot's brain and sends commands to the Teensy to control motors and gather various sensor values:

- 2 TOF distance sensors
- TEMT6000 Ambient light sensor
- 2 IR sensors
- Dual motors with encoders
- MAX1704X fuel gauge 

I'm also using the Playdate's integrated sensors:
- Accelerometer
- Microphone

Additionnal Vision AI camera powered by [Huskylens](https://www.dfrobot.com/product-1922.html) will be compatible.

PlayBot's frame is fully 3D printed. A complete bill of materials and assembly instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/GuybrushTreep/PlayBot/tree/main/hardware) 

## üíæ Firmware

You can flash the [firmware](https://github.com/GuybrushTreep/PlayBot/tree/main/src/PlayBot) using the Arduino IDE and Teensyduino add-on available [here](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/teensyduino.html).

## üì± Companion App

<img title="Power Board" src="../main/images/App.jpg" width="350">

The app, written in Lua, needs to be sideloaded onto the Playdate and is located in a [separate repository](https://github.com/GuybrushTreep/pd-playbot-app).

## üé® Custom rig
![PlaybotRig](images/Robot_Rig.gif)

A Custom rig and sequence exporter written in python is also available for Blender in a [seperate repository](https://github.com/GuybrushTreep/Playbot_Rig).
Animate, render and export custom animation sequences!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues
* ToF sensors show unreliable readings when pointing into empty space (possibly defective units) - planning to replace with IR sensors
* Battery gauge readings become erratic under high current load - investigation ongoing
